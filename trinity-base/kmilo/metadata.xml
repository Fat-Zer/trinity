	<longdescription>
		This is a kded module that can be extended to support various types of hardware 
		input devices that exist, such as those on keyboards.

		The output device is skinnable, though not extensible by 3rd parties currently.
		This will come in the future when the API is finalised.

		It lacks very much functionality.
